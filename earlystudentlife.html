In the early days of student life, I cherished reading about the lives and discoveries of great scientists who contributed to Sciences and Humanity with
 their noble work. As the time progressed, I developed a keen interest in Sciences and started pursuing these subjects beyond school studies.
 I chose Computer Science after secondary school and that was the first time I came across C++ and got deep interest in the subject.
 I use to practice a lot under guidance of my teacher Mr. Raja Banerjee, the person who made the subject more interesting.
 I developed the code and used to design the inner functions to understand how C++ works internally.
