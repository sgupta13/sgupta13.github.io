After college I joined ADP, Automatic Data Processing Inc., where I got chance to work on business critical projects and got chance to work with assembly language, though I was new to assembler language, I learnt the language on my own and was able to guide my team-mates as well.
 I joined Capgemini after a couple of years, I got chance to work on different technology like HP Exstream Dialogue and I learnt it quickly and worked on various critical tasks under guidance of Mr. Bhupendra Sakhare.
 I joined FIS Global last year and got chance to work on AS400 and resolving complex batch abends.
