I opted for Computer Science and Engineering as my field of study.
</p>
<p>
SBSCET served as a good platform in giving direction to my interests in Computer Science.
 Right from the initial days of my 1st year in the college, I got involved in learning the basics of Computer Science.
 Also, I used to guide my classmates in college in learning C++ as a programming language.
</p>
<p>
During my 2nd year, I got very good exposure on programming languages as well as electronic circuitry and microprocessors.
 At the end of my 2nd year, I did an industrial training of 6 weeks at STEP, IIT-Roorkee on J2EE and got very good technical learning there.
</p>
<p>
My 3rd year introduced me to very interesting subjects like ATM networks and Real time systems. I found these very interesting.
</p>
<p>
My philosophy that everything can be improved and the realization of the wide application of the learning can improve the things around us system strengthened my passion in the field.
</p>
<p>During the final year at college I developed network packet sniffer along with my classmates as major project, we learn more when we apply our learning.
 Also, I did my 6 months industrial training developing Java projects at CMC Limited, A Tata enterprise at Noida, India.
</p>
<p>
Intuition and extensive self-introspection, especially during the practical trainings, helped me to convert my ideas into more tangible and applicable results.
 Curriculum courses definitely served as a good source of knowledge. I enjoyed the company of my teachers with whom I was able to learn so much.
 It was deeply fulfilling for me.
